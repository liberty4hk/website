# Website repo for http://liberty4hk.github.io
Collaborative repo for the Hugo site. Pull requests welcome.

This site is currently under construction and we can only accept articles. Please find submission instructions below.

## How to contribute using this repository

### Contributing articles

_Pre-requisites:_ you'll need a GitHub account. If you're unfamiliar with Markdown, it will also be helpful to use a Markdown editor such as [Typora (for Windows users)](https://typora.io/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), or [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/). 

1. Create a Markdown post (files with the extension `.md`) and commit, placing this in the `content/writing` sub-directory. 
    - You can either do this by **creating a new file** or **uploading a file**. 
    - Please ensure that your article properly specifies all the required fields, such as author, date, source, etc. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown formatting, check out this [documentation](https://markdown-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html).
    - You can check out the **Raw** version of [this post](https://github.com/liberty4hk/website/blob/master/content/writing/dont-congratulate-us.md) as a template guide.

2. Create a pull request. The admins of this site will try to review the PR as soon as we can, within 3-4 days (please understand - we are all volunteers here!) 

Please refer to the contributing guide for more information.

### Contributing changes to existing pages

You can also contribute changes to existing pages, where the main difference is that you are editing a page, as opposed to adding a new document to the repository. Once you are happy with your edits, commit your changes and submit a pull request. We will try to review within 3-4 days and the changes will be live on the site if no changes are required. 

### Contributing new pages

You can also contribute new pages, where the main differences versus the process for contribute articles are:

- The Markdown documents should be saved directly under `content`, and **not** `content/writing`
- The content of these pages should be meaningfully different from the page categories that currently exist on the site (e.g. Art, Music, Writing), or at least be significant enough as a stand-alone subject. 

## How to contribute by email / form

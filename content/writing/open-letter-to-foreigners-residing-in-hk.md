On the 27th of October, 1941 the Winnipeg Grenadiers embarked for Hong Kong from their prior post in Jamaica and Bermuda. They were in Hong Kong for no more than two months when the Japanese first landed. This was not their homeland, they had only been here 2 months and hardly knew their way around, but that didn't stop them from doing their duty, and fighting to protect this great nation of ours, and if need be, dying for this nation.

It does not matter if you are Gweilo, Filipino, Nepali or if you belong to any other people, this land is our land and our land is your land. It matters not if you are ethnically a Hong Konger, nor does it matter if you were even born in this land, so long as you live here and call this land your home, you have a stake in this movement.
Just as the Winnipeg Grenadiers picked up arms to defend this land, so too shall the residents of Hong Kong. To say that this isn't your land and isn't your fight is to admit defeat and to show cowardice. We can win this, but if we are to win this great struggle against the communist dictatorship we must all take up arms and stand together, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, no matter if you are black, white, asian, coloured, or any other pigment.
The British won both World Wars not by being fractured, but uniting together as one force, we too should follow in their footsteps if we seek victory over the red heathen.

God save the Queen,
God Bless Hong Kong.

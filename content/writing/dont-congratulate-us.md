I've been getting messages from expats and friends from overseas, congratulating the people of HK for a job well done. It's not a job well done. All that's happened is Carrie Lam finally doing what she should have done from the start, at extremely low political cost, trying to cool HK off before the Oct 1st National Day festivities to save face for the CCP, and maybe in response to the Human Rights and Democracy Act.

We're nowhere close to getting an independent investigatory committee to properly report on police abuse, gross government incompetence, and the atrocities on our people. Universal suffrage isn't here yet. We've been basically living in a goddamn police state, and who knows who the police will come after next.

We don't buy your empty promises Carrie, and I really hope the people of HK, and everyone around the world who has shown us so much love and attention, can stay focused on our objectives, refuse to be content with tiny victories, and keep marching till we achieve justice and real democracy.

Five Demands, Not One Less.

Take Back Hong Kong, the Revolution of Our Time.

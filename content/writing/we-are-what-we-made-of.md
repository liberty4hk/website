Beginning from every day <br>
tears are shed: their tails are puffs <br>
of smoke. Beginning from yesterday <br>
walls are covered in squared colours, <br>
street names changed. Beginning from then <br>
poetry can mean, be, and stay. Beginning <br>
from June 2019, people <br>
in a city look at each other: <br>
million faces, million thoughts, <br>
united in water, practice, slogans. <br>
Beginning from now, <br>
there is no turning back, no stopping. <br>
We are what we are made of: <br>
desperation and unbeatable will. <br>
This is the beginning of the open <br>
secret that we donâ€™t ever quit.

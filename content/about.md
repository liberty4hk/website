## About Liberty for Hong Kong

**Liberty for Hong Kong**, or **L4HK** is a non-profit and collaborative project to crowdsource and document Hong Kong's journey to achieving meaningful freedom, democracy, and autonomy. This project was first created in the wake of the 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill protests. Check us out on GitHub.

L4HK is not supported or funded by any organisation.

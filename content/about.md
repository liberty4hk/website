## About Liberty for Hong Kong

**Liberty for Hong Kong**, or **L4HK** is a non-profit and collaborative project to crowdsource and document Hong Kong's journey to achieving meaningful freedom, democracy, and autonomy. This project was first created in the wake of the 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill protests. Check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/liberty4hk/website).

L4HK is not supported or funded by any organisation. 

## Introduction

The 2019 protests against the controversial extradition bill in Hong Kong unearthed a network of underlying factors and forces which threaten to erode the civil liberties of its citizens. Amongst these factors include:

- the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) being used as a political tool for the Hong Kong Government, and ultimately Beijing
- the presence of a ready-to-strike propaganda force which spreads Chinese nationalist propaganda on a wide range of social media platforms.[^1]
- the use of _agent provocateurs_ by the HKPF to encourage chaos and to tarnage the reputation of the young protestors [^2]
- the impotence of the Hong Kong Government, as revealed in the Chief Executive Carrie Lam's _leaked_ recording [^3]

Dear Hongkongers,

We are protesters from the civic society. If there’s a choice, we wish we didn’t have to protest against tyranny with our own bodies, and didn’t have to occupy the Hong Kong Legislative Council as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Government. But the Government has put aside all principles and procedures, ignored the demands of Hong Kong People, and repeated their lame arguments and lied over and over again. By facing with this rule and unreasonable government, we will have no choice but to fight back with justice, conscience and love of both Hong Kong and HongKongers.

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been established for 22 years, and both the political and economic situation are getting worse. After Carrie Lam became the Chief Executive, the situation of Hong Kong become worse. The Government has been ignoring the demands of millions of Hong Kong people, and pushed for the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance Amendment Bill (a.k.a Extradition Bill to China).

Out of their love for Hong Kong, HongKongers have been trying all methods in June to try to pursuade the government to withdraw the Bill. Some did so peacefully, some bravely, some rationally, some even got injured. However, the Government decided to ignore the public, and started treating people as enemies.

The current Government of Hong Kong is no longer putting HongKongers as first priority. To ensure the voice of the Hong Kong people are heard, we, Hong Kong citizens, are forced to take non-cooperative actions, like occupying streets, or even the Legislative Council today.

Society may criticize us for the occupy action today. But what is the main reason for the sharp division in society? What is the main cause of the ever-increasing public grievance? Why is HongKongers being forced into this position? We are not armed, nor being violent, we are only moving forward bravely with a heart of justice, hoping the Government will get back on the right track in time.

We, protesters, are now requesting the Government, for the following five appeals:-

1. Completely withdraw Extradition Bill.
2. Retract the proclamation that protests on 9th June and 12th June were riots
3. Withdraw criminal charges against all protesters
4. Thoroughly investigate abuse of powers by the police.
5. Dissolve the Legislative Council by administrative order, and immediately implement Dual Universal Suffrage.

Since the “Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Bill Protest” began, three martyrs have died already. We will not forget our sadness and our anger, but we will keep kindness in our hearts, and we wish no more people will die for the cause of freedom, justice and democracy. We hope the society will stick together, fight against tyranny and draconian laws, and protect Hong Kong together.

各位香港市民，

我們是一群來自民間的示威者。萬不得已，我們並不想走上以身對抗暴政的路，以佔領香港特區政府立法會作為我們談判的籌碼；但滿口謊言、滿口歪理的政府卻無意回應香港人不斷走上街的訴求。我們只好以公義、良知、以及對香港、對香港人無窮無盡的愛，去抗衡橫蠻的政府。

香港特區政府成立至今22年，政經民生每況愈下。現任特首林鄭月娥上台後，情況變本加厲，更漠視民間逾百萬民意，推出「送中惡法」。市民於6月起前仆後繼，各盡其力，或和平、或理性、或奮勇、或受傷流血，以一顆熱愛香港之心，懇求政府撤回修例，而政府置若罔若，不諳民情，竟置香港大眾於不顧，甚至以民為敵。

現任特區政府已非以港人行先，為使政府聆聽港人聲音，我等市民不得不進行各種佔領，不合作運動、乃至今日佔領立法會行動。社會或對我等佔領者有所批評，但追本溯源？社會撕裂之誘因為何？民怨每日俱增之本源為何？香港何辜？香港人何以被追逼至此？我等港人沒有武裝，沒有暴力，只能以秉持正義於心，無畏無懼，奮勇向正。希望能香港政府能及時回首，重回正軌及時回首，重回正軌：

我們佔領者，要求政府完成五大訴求：
一、徹底撤回修例
二、收回暴動定義
三、撤銷對今為所有反送中抗爭者控罪
四、徹底追究警隊濫權情況
五、以行政命令解散立法會，立即實行雙真普選
「反送中運動」發展至今，在三位年輕市民殉道殉道。我等未忘憂憤，然心存善念，不願香港再有為民主、為自由、為公義再添亡魂。希望社會大眾團結一致，對抗惡法，對抗暴政，共同守護香港。
